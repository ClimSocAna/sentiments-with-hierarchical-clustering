> **Installation:** We advise to use the `conda` environment to install the required packages, as this is the recommonded approach
> for some of the packages. Setup and activate the environment by running
> ```
> conda env create -f environment.yml
> conda activate clustering-pipeline
>```

> [!NOTE]
> As we cannot share the X data used in the paper, the [10kGNAD](https://tblock.github.io/10kGNAD/) datasets,
